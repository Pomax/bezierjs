# PWM Lookup Table Generator

Based on bezier.js to make a tool that can let Industrial designers effectively and efficiently convey to Electrical Engineers and Firmware Engineers what kind of LED lighting profiles they want.

This tool is totally a work in progress, and is probably not ready for you to use, yet.

A live demo of the current state of code is available here: [https://internetofawesome.github.io/bezierjs/](https://internetofawesome.github.io/bezierjs/)
